    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    ```

   Alternatively, create a `.env` file in the project root:

    ```plaintext
    DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_token_here
    CHANNEL_ID=your_discord_channel_id_here
    ```

4. **Run the Bot**

    ```bash
    python bot.py
    ```

### 2. Relative Strength Index (RSI)
   - Provides signals when the RSI falls below 30 (buy) or rises above 70 (sell).

### 3. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
   - Utilizes a 12-day and 26-day EMA to generate crossover signals.
